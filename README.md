A pure-Rust implementation of [LIBSVM](https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm), for
when you want LIBSVM's model and data formats without linking the C/C++ library.
It covers the same SVM types, kernels, sparse text format, model files, and
command-line tools as upstream.

The aim is numerical equivalence, not bitwise identity. A verification pipeline
checks this implementation against a pinned upstream LIBSVM build across
classification, regression, one-class, probability, and precomputed-kernel
cases, and CI compile-checks the core crate for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

## What you get

- No C runtime or `libsvm-sys2` FFI dependency
- Reads and writes LIBSVM sparse problem files and model files
- The familiar command-line tools: `svm-train-rs`, `svm-predict-rs`, `svm-scale-rs`
- Solver, kernels, prediction, probability, and I/O all in plain Rust, so you can
  read and test them without crossing an FFI boundary
- One runtime dependency (`thiserror`)
- Reproducible differential tests against a pinned upstream LIBSVM build

## How this differs from the `libsvm` crate

The [`libsvm`](https://docs.rs/libsvm/latest/libsvm/) crate gives you high-level
Rust bindings to the C LIBSVM library through `libsvm-sys2`. Reach for that if
you specifically want the original C implementation.

This crate instead reimplements the LIBSVM algorithms and file formats in Rust.
Reach for it when you want Rust-native deployment, easier cross-compilation, or
code you can inspect and test without an FFI boundary. If you are moving from C
LIBSVM or `libsvm-sys2`, start with [`docs/MIGRATION.md`](docs/MIGRATION.md).

## Performance

Native CLI benchmarks compare the Rust binaries (`svm-*-rs`) against the vendored
C LIBSVM reference on the same datasets and parameters. A ratio below `1.0` means
Rust was faster in the measured run.

| Operation | Cases | Rust/C median ratio |
|---|---:|---:|
| `predict` | 40 | `0.828` |
| `predict_probability` | 30 | `0.838` |
| `train` | 40 | `0.907` |
| `train_probability` | 30 | `0.979` |

Measured on 2026-10-08 (UTC; Linux, AMD Ryzen 9 9900X, 30 runs per command). Rust is
faster at the median for every operation, but not in every case: the slowest
remaining cases are SVR probability training on `housing_scale`, up to
`1.11` times the C time. See
[`reference/benchmark_report.md`](reference/benchmark_report.md) and
[`examples/comparison_summary.json`](examples/comparison_summary.json).

## Parity Status

Current committed verification artifacts against pinned upstream LIBSVM v337:

| Artifact | Scope | Pass | Warn | Fail | Skip |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `reference/compare_summary.json` | 70 cases | 65 | 29 | 0 | 5 |
| `reference/differential_report.md` | 250 configs | 237 | 3 | 0 | 10 |

In `compare_summary.json` the warning column counts individual probability
mismatch events, not cases — a case can record warnings and still pass. The
warnings are documented numerical near-parity cases, not prediction-logic
failures. Differential baselines are recorded in the reference artifacts; libc
`rand()` replication exists for macOS and Linux. See
[`reference/differential_report.md`](reference/differential_report.md) and
[`reference/tolerance_policy.md`](reference/tolerance_policy.md).

The differential counts depend on the platform. The suite regenerates its
synthetic datasets and builds upstream LIBSVM with the local compiler. The
committed `reference/differential_report.md` was made on macOS (Apple clang 21,
see `reference/reference_provenance.json`). On Linux (gcc 13) the same code gives
240 pass, 0 warn, 0 fail, 10 skip. To check that a change keeps parity, run the
full suite on the unchanged and on the changed code on the same machine, and
compare the two `reference/differential_results.json` files case by case.

## Security Considerations

`libsvm-rs` treats `.libsvm` problem files and `.model` files as untrusted text
input by default.

- Default loaders enforce byte, line-length, support-vector, class-count, and
  feature-index caps through
  [`LoadOptions`](https://docs.rs/libsvm-rs/latest/libsvm_rs/io/struct.LoadOptions.html).
- Problem files reject malformed `index:value` tokens, non-ascending feature
  indices, over-limit feature indices, oversized input, oversized lines, and
  embedded NUL bytes.
- Model files additionally validate header consistency before support-vector
  allocation: `nr_class`, `total_sv`, `rho`, `label`, `nr_sv`, `probA`,
  `probB`, probability-density marks, precomputed-kernel rows, and non-negative
  `gamma` for gamma-using kernels must agree with the model invariants.
- The optional `serde` model path reuses the same model validation boundary as
  the text loader. Deserializing an `SvmParameter` performs no validation, and
  `svm_train` does not validate either — callers must run
  `SvmParameter::validate()` or `check_parameter(problem, param)` themselves
  unless the parameter came from `SvmParameterBuilder::build()`.
- The optional `rayon` paths consume fold shuffling PRNG state serially before
  parallel work. The glibc-compatible LCG used for parity is not shared across
  workers.
- `SvmParameterBuilder::build()` delegates to `SvmParameter::validate()`; checks
  that need training data remain in `check_parameter(problem, param)`.
- Public loader paths return structured errors for malformed text input within
  the configured caps; they should not panic on adversarial files.

The loaders do not prove that a model is statistically meaningful, was trained
from a specific dataset, is safe to use for a regulated decision, or is
cryptographically authentic. Constant-time arithmetic, side-channel resistance,
sandboxed execution, and model signing are out of scope for this crate. Use
`LoadOptions::trusted_input()` only for files whose source and size are already
controlled.

To report a vulnerability, follow [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## When to Use It

- You are building a Rust service or CLI and want SVM training/prediction
  without a C build or runtime dependency.
- You already have LIBSVM-format data or models and want to keep that workflow;
  see [`docs/MIGRATION.md`](docs/MIGRATION.md) for C LIBSVM and `libsvm-sys2`
  migration notes.
- You need C-SVC, nu-SVC, one-class SVM, epsilon-SVR, or nu-SVR with standard
  LIBSVM kernels.
- You want a small, inspectable Rust implementation for scientific or embedded
  deployment work.

## When Not to Use It

- If you need exact bit-for-bit identity with upstream LIBSVM, use upstream
  LIBSVM directly.
- If you only need Python workflows, scikit-learn already wraps LIBSVM for
  `SVC`, `SVR`, and `OneClassSVM`.
- For very large linear problems, prefer `liblinear`, `LinearSVC`, SGD-style
  methods, or kernel approximations.
- If you need GPU training or online/incremental updates, this crate does not
  provide them.

## Features

- **All 5 SVM types**: C-SVC, nu-SVC, one-class SVM, epsilon-SVR, nu-SVR (`-s 0..4`)
- **All 5 kernel types**: linear, polynomial, RBF, sigmoid, precomputed (`-t 0..4`)
- **Model file compatibility**: reads and writes LIBSVM text format at `%.17g` precision, so a model trained with the C library loads in Rust and vice versa
- **Optional serde support**: enable the `serde` feature to serialize `SvmModel`/`SvmParameter` inside a Rust application's own state (for example JSON or bincode). Deserialization reuses the model validation boundary, but this is not a C/LIBSVM interchange format; use `save_model`/`load_model` text files for compatibility with other LIBSVM tools.
- **Probability estimation** (`-b 1`): Platt scaling for binary classification, pairwise coupling for multiclass, Laplace-corrected regression, density marks for one-class
- **Cross-validation**: stratified k-fold for classification (preserves class proportions), simple k-fold for regression and one-class. Enable the optional `rayon` feature to train CV folds in parallel while keeping fold assignment serial and deterministic; default builds still avoid the `rayon` dependency. Parallel fold diagnostics are suppressed to avoid interleaved output. Peak memory can include up to `min(k, rayon_threads)` simultaneous kernel caches of `SvmParameter::cache_size` each; the cache size is never silently divided.
- **CLI tools**: `svm-train-rs`, `svm-predict-rs`, `svm-scale-rs`, matching upstream flag syntax

### Cargo feature flags

Cargo features are opt-in. The default feature set is empty (`default = []`), so
library builds keep the single runtime dependency on `thiserror` unless you
enable an optional feature:

- `serde`: enables `Serialize`/`Deserialize` for model and parameter types.
- `rayon`: enables parallel cross-validation folds; serial behavior remains the
  default.

## Installation

### As a library

```toml
[dependencies]
libsvm-rs = "0.9.0"
```

MSRV is Rust `1.80` for all builds.

### CLI tools

```bash
# Clone and build from source (CLIs are workspace members, not published separately)
git clone https://github.com/ricardofrantz/libsvm-rs.git
cd libsvm-rs
cargo build --release -p svm-train-rs -p svm-predict-rs -p svm-scale-rs
# Binaries are in target/release/
```

## Quick Start

### Library API

```rust
use libsvm_rs::io::{load_problem, save_model, load_model};
use libsvm_rs::predict::{predict, predict_values};
use libsvm_rs::train::svm_train;
use libsvm_rs::{KernelType, SvmParameter, SvmParameterBuilder, SvmType};
use std::path::Path;

// Load training data in LIBSVM sparse format
let problem = load_problem(Path::new("data/heart_scale")).unwrap();

// Configure parameters with the builder (defaults match LIBSVM)
let param = SvmParameterBuilder::new()
    .svm_type(SvmType::CSvc)
    .kernel_type(KernelType::Rbf)
    .gamma(1.0 / 13.0)  // 1/num_features
    .c(1.0)
    .build()
    .unwrap();

// Direct struct construction is also public API.
let _direct_param = SvmParameter {
    svm_type: SvmType::CSvc,
    kernel_type: KernelType::Rbf,
    gamma: 1.0 / 13.0,
    c: 1.0,
    ..SvmParameter::default()
};

// Train
let model = svm_train(&problem, &param);

// Predict a single instance
let label = predict(&model, &problem.instances[0]);
println!("predicted label: {label}");

// Get decision values (useful for ranking or custom thresholds)
let mut dec_values = vec![0.0f64; model.nr_class * (model.nr_class - 1) / 2];
let label = predict_values(&model, &problem.instances[0], &mut dec_values);
println!("decision values: {dec_values:?}");

// Save/load models (compatible with C LIBSVM format)
save_model(Path::new("heart_scale.model"), &model).unwrap();
let loaded = load_model(Path::new("heart_scale.model")).unwrap();
```

### Cross-Validation

```rust
use libsvm_rs::cross_validation::svm_cross_validation;

let targets = svm_cross_validation(&problem, &param, 5);  // 5-fold CV
let accuracy = targets.iter().zip(&problem.labels)
    .filter(|(pred, actual)| (*pred - *actual).abs() < 1e-10)
    .count() as f64 / problem.labels.len() as f64;
println!("CV accuracy: {:.2}%", accuracy * 100.0);
```

### Probability Estimation

```rust
use libsvm_rs::predict::predict_probability;

// Enable probability estimation during training
let mut param = SvmParameter::default();
param.probability = true;
param.kernel_type = KernelType::Rbf;
param.gamma = 1.0 / 13.0;

let model = svm_train(&problem, &param);
if let Some((label, probs)) = predict_probability(&model, &problem.instances[0]) {
    println!("label: {label}, class probabilities: {probs:?}");
}
```

## Verification Pipeline

### Overview

Upstream parity is locked to LIBSVM `v337` (December 2025) via `reference/libsvm_upstream_lock.json`. The differential verification suite builds the upstream C binary from a pinned Git commit, runs both implementations on identical datasets with identical parameters, and compares:

- **Prediction labels**: exact match for classification, tolerance-bounded for regression
- **Decision values**: relative and absolute tolerance checks
- **Model structure**: number of SVs, rho values, sv_coef values
- **Probability outputs**: probA/probB parameters, probability predictions

### Running Verification

```bash
# 1. Validate that the upstream lock file is consistent
bash scripts/check_libsvm_reference_lock.sh

# 2. Build the pinned upstream C reference binary and record provenance
bash scripts/setup_reference_libsvm.sh

# 3. Run differential verification
#    Quick scope: 45 configs (canonical datasets × SVM types × kernel types)
python3 scripts/run_differential_suite.py

#    Full scope: 250 configs (canonical + generated + tuned parameters)
DIFF_SCOPE=full python3 scripts/run_differential_suite.py

#    Strict mode: disable the targeted SVR warning downgrade
DIFF_ENABLE_TARGETED_SVR_WARN=0 DIFF_SCOPE=full python3 scripts/run_differential_suite.py

#    Sensitivity study: override the global non-probability relative tolerance
DIFF_NONPROB_REL_TOL=2e-5 DIFF_SCOPE=full python3 scripts/run_differential_suite.py

# 4. Run coverage gate (checks line and function coverage thresholds)
bash scripts/check_coverage_thresholds.sh

# 5. Run Rust-vs-C performance benchmarks
BENCH_WARMUP=3 BENCH_RUNS=30 python3 scripts/benchmark_compare.py
```

### Understanding Differential Results

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `pass`  | No parity issues detected under configured tolerances |
| `warn`  | Non-fatal differences detected under explicit, documented policy rules |
| `fail`  | Deterministic parity break — label mismatch or model divergence outside thresholds |
| `skip`  | Configuration not executed (usually because training fails in both implementations) |

Current full-scope status in `reference/differential_report.md` (250 configs,
macOS reference run): 237 pass, 3 warn, 0 fail, 10 skip.

The 3 warnings are:
1. `housing_scale_s3_t2_tuned` — epsilon-SVR near-parity training drift (bounded, cross-predict verified)
2. `gen_extreme_scale_scale_s0_t1_default` — rho-only header drift
3. `gen_extreme_scale_scale_s2_t1_default` — one-class near-boundary label drift

All 10 skips are configurations not executed by the full differential suite.
`reference/compare_summary.json` records the current summary comparison artifact
as 65 pass, 29 warn, 0 fail, 5 skip.

The active tolerance policy is `differential-v3` (documented in `reference/tolerance_policy.md`).

### Targeted Warning Policy

The epsilon-SVR warning for `housing_scale_s3_t2_tuned` has an intentionally narrow guard:

- Applies to **one case ID only**
- Non-probability drift bounds must hold: `max_rel <= 6e-5`, `max_abs <= 6e-4`
- Model drift bounds must hold: `rho_rel <= 1e-5`, `max sv_coef abs diff <= 4e-3`
- **Cross-predict parity** must hold in both directions:
  - Rust predictor on C model matches C predictor on C model
  - C predictor on Rust model matches Rust predictor on Rust model

This confirms the drift comes from training numerics, not prediction logic.

### Verification Artifacts

| Category | Files |
|----------|-------|

| Differential | `reference/differential_results.json`, `reference/differential_report.md` |
| Tolerance | `reference/tolerance_policy.md` |
| Coverage | `reference/coverage_report.md` |
| Performance | `reference/benchmark_results.json`, `reference/benchmark_report.md` |

### Rust vs C++ Timing Figure

Global timing comparison figure (train + predict, per-case ratios, and ratio distributions):

![Rust vs C++ timing comparison](examples/comparison.png)

Statistical summary companion:
- `examples/comparison_summary.json`

To regenerate performance data with stronger statistical confidence before plotting:

```bash
BENCH_WARMUP=3 BENCH_RUNS=30 python3 scripts/benchmark_compare.py
python3 examples/common/make_comparison_figure.py --root . --out examples/comparison.png --summary examples/comparison_summary.json
```

### Parity Claim

No hard differential failures under the default policy, with a small set of
documented, justified warnings — good parity evidence, though not bitwise
identity across all modes. The residual drift comes from training-side numerics
(floating-point accumulation order, shrinking-heuristic timing), not from
prediction logic.

The library crate is in `crates/libsvm/` and the three CLI tools are in `bins/`.
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) describes each module, the SMO
solver, the design decisions, and the notes on numerical equivalence.

## Dependencies

- **Runtime**: `thiserror` (error derive macros)
- **Optional**: `serde` (feature-gated serialization), `rayon` (feature-gated parallel cross-validation)
- **Dev**: `float-cmp` (approximate float comparison), `criterion` (benchmarks), `proptest` (property-based testing)

## Known Limitations

1. **Not bitwise identical**: In the differential suite, non-probability outputs agree with C LIBSVM within relative `1.5e-5` and absolute `1e-8`, except one documented epsilon-SVR case in the macOS reference run (`housing_scale_s3_t2_tuned`, relative drift up to `5.7e-5`). Probability outputs have looser tolerances (see `reference/tolerance_policy.md`). Results are not bit-for-bit identical because floating-point accumulation order differs.
2. **No GPU support**: All computation is CPU-based.
3. **No incremental/online learning**: Full retraining required for new data (same as upstream LIBSVM).
4. **Precomputed kernels require full matrix**: The full n×n kernel matrix must be provided in memory.
